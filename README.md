# How to Add a New Token Logo

To add a new token logo to your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named after the token's address.

    For example, if the token address is `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7`, create a folder with the same name.

2. Put the logo file (`logo.png`) inside the folder you created.

    Make sure the logo file is named `logo.png` and placed in the folder named after the token's address.

Example:

- Token USDT Address: `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7`
- Logo Token: `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7/logo.png`
